# Contributing to computer-science-portfolio

Thank you for your interest! This is an academic archive, so contributions
are primarily welcome in the form of:

- 🐛 **Bug Reports** — if a solution produces incorrect output
- 💡 **Improvements** — better algorithms, cleaner implementations
- 📚 **Documentation** — clarifying explanations or adding comments

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b fix/your-description`
3. Make your changes and commit: `git commit -m 'fix: describe your change'`
4. Push to your fork and open a Pull Request.

## Code Style

- **Java:** Follow standard Java naming conventions (CamelCase for classes).
- **C++:** Use consistent indentation (4 spaces).
- All algorithm implementations must include a comment block explaining
  the time and space complexity.
